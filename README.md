# Stock Diviner - Harvey, Jack, Kevin, William
A joke stock advisor that suggests buy/sell actions depending on past historical performances correlated with some cyclical events like lunar new years, moon phases, etc. This is not stock trading advice. Stock data will be graphed and the cyclical events can be filtered on top of the graph. There will be multiple chart styles such as line and candlestick. The stocks will be limited to Google, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Meta. Our purpose is to create an application that makes ridiculous correlations between stock data and something random.
